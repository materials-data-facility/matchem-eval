A public repository collecting links to state-of-the-art QA and evaluation sets for various ML and LLM applications

* [MaScQA](https://github.com/M3RG-IITD/MaScQA.git): A dataset of 650 challenging questions from the materials domain that require the knowledge and skills of a materials science student who has cleared their undergraduate degree. Questions are classified based on their structure and the materials science domain-based subcategories.
* [ChemQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shangzhu/ChemQA): ChemQA is a Multimodal Question-and-Answering dataset on chemistry reasoning. This work is inspired by IsoBench and ChemLLMBench. Containts 5 QA Tasks in total: Counting Numbers of Carbons and Hydrogens in Organic Molecules, Calculating Molecular Weights in Organic Molecules, Name Conversion: From SMILES to IUPAC, Molecule Captioning and Editing, and retro-synthesis Planning: inspired by [2], adapted from dataset provided in [4], following the same training, validation and evaluation splits.
* [ChemLLMBench](https://github.com/ChemFoundationModels/ChemLLMBench): A comprehensive benchmark on eight chemistry tasks
* [SMolInstruct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/osunlp/SMolInstruct): SMolInstruct is a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality instruction tuning dataset crafted for chemistry. It centers around small molecules, and contains 14 meticulously selected tasks and over 3M samples. This dataset has both SMILES and SELFIES versions, and you could switch to SELFIES by using use_selfies=True when loading. Tasks include name conversion, property prediction, molecule description, and chemical reaction prediction.
